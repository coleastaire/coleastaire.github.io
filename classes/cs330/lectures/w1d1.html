<p>
CS330 is about algorithms, and how they work. How are they the same, and how are they different?
</p>

<p>
Mergesort, Quicksort, bruteforce.
</p>

<p>
We will understand the similarities and differences between different types of algorithms.
eg. where they overlap.
</p>

<p>
Each algorithms has a set of steps. You should be attempting each until you find a step that is not viable to solve the problem.

<p>
How do we identify each?
How do we prove if an algorithm is correct?
How fast is it?
</p>

<p>
Brute Force is the largest topic of the class, for these reasons.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
CAN solve MOST problems

<li>
Best way to learn the problem

<li>
Often the most expedient way to solve small/one-time problems

</ul>

<p>
Brute Force is also the most error prone.
