<em>"In hopes of making a positive impression, we agonize about or appearance. Like savvy politicians, we also monitor other's behavior and expectations and adjust our behavior accordingly."</em>
</p>

<p>
As we enact a new role... we initially feel self-conscious. Gradually, however, what begins as playacting in the theater of life is absorbed into our sense of self.

<div id="The Self-Individualism &amp; Collectivism"><h4 id="Individualism &amp; Collectivism" class="header"><a href="#The Self-Individualism &amp; Collectivism">Individualism &amp; Collectivism</a></h4></div>
<p>
<em><span id="The Self-Individualism &amp; Collectivism-Individualism"></span><strong id="Individualism">Individualism</strong></em> - Identity is self-contained
<em><span id="The Self-Individualism &amp; Collectivism-Collectivism"></span><strong id="Collectivism">Collectivism</strong></em> - Identity is interdependent, and needs less self-regard. (see Shinobu Kitayama and Hazel Markus)
When describing oneself, we tend to offer descriptions of our personal character (honest, tall) or our social identity(Christian, Taurus). Individualist societies tend to answer with character, and collectivist answer social.

<div id="The Self-Self-Esteem"><h4 id="Self-Esteem" class="header"><a href="#The Self-Self-Esteem">Self-Esteem</a></h4></div>
<p>
For individualistic cultures, self-esteem is more personal and less relational. Those feel threatened by attacks on their personal identity. They also tend to persist more when they are succeeding.
In collectivist cultures, they persist when they are failing, so as not to fall short of other's expectations.
Self-esteem can be influenced by cultural and social surroundings. e.g. if a chinese student studies in America.

<ul>
<li>
social comparison theory:

<ul>
<li>
we compare ourselves to other to help us define the standard by which we define ourselves

<li>
when we witness a peer's performance, we cannot help but compare ourselves. we may even privately take some pleasure in their failure.

<li>
when we experience an increase in status, we continue to compare upward, sometimes diminishing our satisfaction

<li>
when people think well of us, it helps us think well of ourselves

<li>
generally, people feel freer to praise than to criticize; they voice their compliments and restrain their gibes

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
"Comparisons with others tend to happen less as the differences between the self and the others we are comparing to increases." - Prof. Hemovich

<em>Looking-Glass Self</em>: How we think others perceive us can be a powerful lend through which we sometimes perceive ourselves.

==== Mr Clean vs Mr Dirty" Employment Study =====
</p>
<ul>
<li>
At job interview, seat the subject near either a clean or dirty person who they think are also interviewing:

<ul>
<li>
measure the self esteem before and after

<li>
participants measure themselves more likely to exceed when next to the dirty person

</ul>

<p>
Individualists (Americans) tend to look more at focal objects in an image and less at surroundings, while collectivists (Japanese) tend to notice more background items. (see Chua &amp; others, 2007; Lewis &amp; others, 2008)
When you describe yourself as above or below average... How do you know? How do you make an informed assessment? What is your benchmark?
</p>

<div id="The Self-Self-Knowledge"><h4 id="Self-Knowledge" class="header"><a href="#The Self-Self-Knowledge">Self-Knowledge</a></h4></div>
<p>
We tend to think that we know ouselves completely, but we are often wrong and/or biased when explaining ourselves. We dismiss matters and often inflate things that don't matter. Especially when causes are ambiguous or subtle.
</p>

<p>
<span id="The Self-Self-Knowledge-&quot;We are remarkably bad predictors of what will make us happy.&quot;"></span><strong id="&quot;We are remarkably bad predictors of what will make us happy.&quot;">"We are remarkably bad predictors of what will make us happy."</strong> - Daniel Gilbert, Stumbling on Happiness, 2007
</p>

<p>
People are also surprisingly faulty when predicting their own behavior, but surprisingly accurate when predicting their peers. e.g. predicting friends' relationship success. (see Tara MadDonald and Michael Ross, 1997) 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Planning Fallacy:

<ul>
<li>
the error is estimating how long it will take for us to complete a task.

<li>
in one study, students finished assignments three weeks later than their "most realistic" prediction and one week later than their "worst-case" prediction

<li>
When self-predicting, it is smarter to predict your own timeline based on your prediction of someone else completing the same task

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Predicting Emotions</em>: studies of "affective forecasting" reveal that people have greatest difficulty predicting the <span id="The Self-Self-Knowledge-intensity"></span><strong id="intensity">intensity</strong> and <span id="The Self-Self-Knowledge-duration"></span><strong id="duration">duration</strong> of their future emotion. (see Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2003)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
when not aroused, one easily mispredicts how they will act when aroused

<li>
when hungry, we mispredict our appetites when not hungry

<li>
we tend to be less upset after breakups than we expect to be

<li>
we predict greater sadness for greater severity natural disasters, but in reality, tend to feel similar sadness regardless of intensity.

</ul>
<p>
Our intuitive theory seems to be: We want. We get. We are happy. However, we often miswant and mispredict how much our current situations affect our happiness.

The activatio of particular associations in memory. Unintended stimuli can "quietly" influence how we interpret and recall events. Studies show how priming ONE thought, even without awareness, can influence other thoughts.

<ul>
<li>
Bargh 1996 Word Study:

<ul>
<li>
exposure to certain types of words can effect behaviors. One group shows "slow" words, tended to move slowly. Other group shows "fast" words, moved more quickly

<li>
 activated what is called the <em><span id="Social Priming-Studies-Stereotype Prime"></span><strong id="Stereotype Prime">Stereotype Prime</strong></em>

<li>
seperately, they also primes 3 groups with either "polite", "rude", or "neutral" words. subjects were less likely to interrupt if primed with polite words. 

</ul>
<li>
Bargh 1999 Chameleon Effect:

<ul>
<li>
behavior matching or 'mirroring' results from group perception-behavior link

<li>
Subjects rated confederates as more pleasant and 'likeable' in conditions where they mimic the subject

</ul>
<li>
Holland 2005 'Smells Like Clean Spirit' Study:

<ul>
<li>
subjects exposed to scent of all-purpose cleaners were quicker do identify "clean" words

<li>
they were also more likely to clean their desks

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<em><span id="Social Priming-Studies-Stereotype Prime"></span><strong id="Stereotype Prime">Stereotype Prime</strong></em>: an automatic and often subconscious response based on social representations. Activating a stereotype can influence future perceptions in stereotype-consistent ways. Information is stored as schemas that are frequently activated together (which generates higher accessibility.

<p>
We make social inferences via verbal/non-verbal expressions and construals to explain why people behave certain ways. eg. how good are we at interpreting when people lie?
People attend to multiple non-verbal/verbal cues to decode and understand social situations.
Some pople, like those who practice, seem to do better.

Persistence of attitude (biased belief) even after being discredited.

<ul>
<li>
We tend to prefer what we already believe

<li>
difficult to demolish a falsehood once we conjure up a rationale for it.

<li>
Especially difficult when we have peers that can anecdotally reinforce the belief

<li>
Belief perserverence is NOT Confirmation Bias

<li>
Overcoming bias:

<ul>
<li>
prompt feedback

<li>
counter attitudinal thinking

<li>
must unpack ideas to establish more realistic estimates
