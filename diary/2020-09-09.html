<p>
I am feeling scattered this morning. The past few mornings have involved waking up to my 6am alarm, ignoring it to fall back asleep, then upon awakening fully, procrastinating getting out of bed. I watch videos, listen to podcasts, masturbate. I'm not sure why, but I seem to be losing my morning discipline now that I don't have the accountability to be somewhere. Accountability has proven itself the most powerful motivator for me. No matter how early, if I am to be held accountable by someone else for my tardiness, I manage to make it on time, and consistently. I was rarely more than five minutes late to work over the course of my four months at Sahalee this Summer, and I only took 1 sick day. Knowing that, why is it that when I don't have to work, I can barely make it out of bed before 8pm, when I've managed to get up at 4am for the past four months?

I think the answer lies in the lack of accountability. Currently, I will not be held accountable by anyone but myself for when I get up. This throws the incentives out of balance. At Sahalee, if I don't show up on time, I don't get paid. At home, I can be as late as I want, and I might even get praised by my roommate. Naturally, I'm sure she'd prefer to have the place to herself in the mornings as she did for the Summer.

I need to figure out a way to hold myself accountable for waking up with discipline. I need to remember how shitty I feel after a day of masturbatory naps. I need to lay out a reward structure for morning work time. 
</p>

<p>
These are the things I'd like to work on in my free time today and tomorrow. My health and motivation are fleeting while my freedom is rising. I am not practicing integrity in my private time, I am not practicing discipline. I have lost structure. It is integral that I get it back.
