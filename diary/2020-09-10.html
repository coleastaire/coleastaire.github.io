Whats on my mind? Well, lots is on my mind. Rachel and I may have broken up for good last night. I feel lonely and sad. I feel like I dont have the right to be as upset as I am. It's pretty obvious at this stage that I wasn't nearly as thankful or appreciative as I should have been. It's true that we only ever really know what we cherish when it's fleeting. I'm not sure what to do right now. I have been distant the last few weeks, emotionally. I have been longing for other women, I have been ruminating over the long-term prospects with Rachel. We are compatible in so many ways and incompatible in so many as well. She wants to settle down and have children soon. She is the type of woman with whom I would like to have kids... but I'm not ready yet. I don't even have a job right now, let alone a career. And with Covid, who knows where I will get a job. What if the only offer I get when I graduate is in New York, or Los Angeles? It is these questions that likely led her to reconsider, just as they did to me. Now I'm lonely, and I deserve it. If nothing else, I want her to know how much I appreciate the time we spent together. I want her to know how much it meant to me to have someone there when the world was crumbling. I want her to know how thankful I am for the way she admires me. I want her to know how thankful I am for the way she loved me.
