% What's on my mind?
</p>

<p>
I'm feeling a bit better today. Not quite as sad. Not quite as lonely. I woke up early and finished a full morning routine. The one that I have been trying to habituate for a few weeks. I did yoga, ate breakfast, made coffee, made my bed, and now I'm here, writing. I hope to keep this up. 
</p>

<p>
It will be important over the next few days for me to lean on my close friends. The people I can trust. John, Cody, and my team at school. I should not hesitate to let them know that I am struggling emotionally, and that it has impacted my productivity.

I hope Rachel is doing well. I miss her deeply. My inability to be there for her exacerbates the feeling of guilt I have about not showing her how much I care for her since I returned from Atlanta. I did not adapt. We planned to social distance ourselves from one another for 10 days after my return, out of safety for her mother and others. This meant no physical affection, apart from texting. I did not handle that well. I let the lack of physicality drain my desire for her. I began looking at other women - other, seemingly more accessible women with the longing and desire that I wish I had shown her. Even through her time of struggle, as she grew ill, I sleepwalked through our interactions. Robotic and cold. My body was there for her, but was my heart?

It takes loging her to find the answer to that question, and the answer is no. I was protecting my heart. I hid my heart as a safety measure, a 'just-in-case' the social distancing was really her losing her heart for me. I didn't take the time to remember the important things about our relationship. The beautiful things that brought us so close together in the first place. We conquered a global crisis, together. And without eachother our lives would have been filled with much more misery. We were a source of strength for eachother. It was magical, the timing of it. I can only pray that the next time there's a global crisis that I will be this lucky. I musn't grow complacent, and give thanks where it is due. I must be thankful for the effort and care Rachel put into our relationship. As imperfect as it was bound to be, we made something really special, and I will never forget it.
