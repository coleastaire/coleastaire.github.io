This coffee is on my mind. Rachel is on my mind. Schoolwork is on my mind. My health is on my mind.
I had an interesting weekend, which prompted me to think about these things. The three amigos got back together and went out for some beerpong. We had a great time. Just like old times. The weekend definitely put my already weak sleep discipline into a chokehold. I stayed up until 3am two nights in a row. Not good. Now that the week has begun, I can do my best to get it back in order. Yes, I did say the whole three amigos were back. That's all three of us. The famous Cody has returned, and he's the same as he always was. We had great conversations about games and tech and life and romance. He's surprisingly wise, given that he just doesn't seem like the type of person to retain the type of wisdom that he has. I hope that his family is doing well. John's doing well, also. He wants to settle down with a woman. He's tired of dating without the "attached strings". I advised him against it, but perhaps I'm a bit biased, being newly single. I reminisce on our old days of killing it at Flatstick. I'm very glad to have gotten back with the crew after so long, I needed it.

AS for Rachel, I'm not so sure what's going to happen. My suspicions are the same as before. I think the relationship is over. That said, I still feel like I need to thank her again. For playing a crucial part in my life during the apocalypse. I'm going to do something nice for her when I see her this week.
