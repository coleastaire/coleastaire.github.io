<p>
I'm feeling decent this morning. A little groggy, and tough to get up, but my flexibility is high and I don't feel as tight in my shoulders and chest as usual. The yoga has been helping.

This is going to be a short entry today. I've got work on my mind big time. Today, I need to take good notes in class, study for my most difficult assignments, and get to versioning my GAM changed into the repository. Shouldn't be a long day. Oh, I'd also like to go get the new grill from Cody's place tonight. Maybe I'll see Rachel while I'm over there.
