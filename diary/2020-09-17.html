How am I feeling this morning?
I feel good. Besides a bit of indigesion, I am having a very good morning so far. I woke up early with energy to get up, I don't feel too tight around the shoulders and neck, and I finished breakfast and coffee at good pace to get to work before 7am. I am happy with this. If I can do this most days, I think I'll be well off.
That said, I am worried about a few things. CS330, for one, is going to be a tough class. It requires discrete math skill that I lack confidence in. Luckily, there are a few very nice people in my class who were willing to help last time we had a study session. I expect I will be leaning on my friend structure throughout the class. I am also worried about Rachel. I am seeing her tonight, and I'm unsure of how I will react. It makes me a bit nervous, but even just writing this sentence out helps. Here's what I need to do. Relax, and resolve myself to just go with the flow when I see her. We both have had rough weeks, I'm sure, and we will likely just need some company and some laughs. That's something we are very good at. I need to see our dinner as an opportunity to escape. A reward for my hard work.
Now all I have to do is work hard... Hehe.
